### Asigment III: Support Vector Machines

--------

Due Date: Jan 20th


--------

In this assignment you have to write small blocks of code to answer and explain the questions in blow.



##### Q1. Why is it important to sclae the inputs when using SVMs?
 ( Use any data, e.g Iris)



##### Q2. How can an SVM classifier output a confidence score when it classifies an instance? demonstrate with a block of code.


##### Q3. If you train an SVM classifier with an RBF Kernel and you find out that it underfits the training set. Should you increase/ decrease the gamma? What about C? write a code to prove your statement.




##### Q4. How can you train a SVM regressor on a sample data?
